</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Imagine that you had never seen fire before. And decided to figure out what to do with it. How would you figure this out?</p>
<p>So there's only two things that matter before product market fit. That's talking with users and building the product. I've heard this discribed as you need a hacker and a business man. It might not be obvious what's important and what needs to happen when.</p>
<p>Talking with users is better than adding tracking to a website. Tracking will tell you what people are doing. Talking with users will help you know what to add and what to take away. For example, our first website was built to make non-animators happy. It included links to our investors and a long discription of features we're planning on building in the future. Analytics might have told us we were doing a good job. And in some sense we were. </p>
<p>But for animators they just wanted to know what the product is that we had built today and when they could use the product. </p>
<p>Benefits
1. You build what people actually want
2. You avoid long pros vs. cons discussions and instead make meaningful progress
The reality here is that you don't really know what is and isn't going to work. </p>
