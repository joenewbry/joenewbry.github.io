</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I recently visited the empire state building and this relates almost directly to raising venture funding. Most days working at a startup you're on the proverbial street dealing with day to day pieces. How to fix the gif on the website that doesn't display correctly? How to make sure a key employee doesn't quit? Should you run your ML model locally or in the cloud? But when you talk about VCs none of that is going to matter. They want you to forget about everything that's going wrong with the business and assume it's fixable and then image that you're able to carve the world as you see it. They want vision and they want the view from the top of the empire state building.</p>
<p>Direct quotes from investors.</p>
<p>Link to Mike Dempseys article on why your VC idea might not be big enough</p>
<p>But how is this a venture scale business? Asked by most investors that I'm talking to. Comps suggest this could be as large as Adobe Animate $120M ARR. But we need a $2.5B business to make investing make sense for us.</p>
<p>So then we start brainstorming about how to make this venture make sense. And start talking about changing the way people communicate using their phones. </p>
<p>So be prepared for the perspective shift from talking with VCs. If you're building a better email client then you won't need to clearly explain how this becomes a $1B+ business but if you're working on something more niche there will be questions along the way. Uber had similar challenges where people saw the service as a something for limoes and missed the broader applications of the busienss. [find article link]</p>
<p>And none of this matter's if you have a profitable business. Becoming profitable is harder than raising VC money and better for your business.</p>
