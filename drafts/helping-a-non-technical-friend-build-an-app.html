</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>About once a week someone says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hey I have an app idea ..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few minutes later I have a rough idea of Facewook. A social network for Wookies. With high definition audio support for Wookie chortles and unique send fur by mail option.</p>
<p>"So what do ya think it'd cost? 5k or something? Hoping to get everything done by next Friday for a startup pitch."</p>
<p>At this point I'm pretty checked out and cringe internally thinking a variety of things:</p>
<p>Have they thought at all about the problem they're trying to solve? Facebook for wookies --isn't-- is a new idea but unless Elon lands us on far away planets sometime soon the market size is zero.</p>
<p>Do they think making an app is an easy way to make money? Most businesses take about 4ish years to build, not a frantic weekend and an app store release.</p>
<p>Are they going to ask me for help? Guess they already have and now I'll be the bad guy if I say no crushing their dreams.</p>
<p>I should have introduced myself as someone who builds and sells businesses. Not a software engineer.</p>
<p><em>And</em> I'm interested and love building software so I say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sure I'll help."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's my rough gudie for deciding to get involved in making an app a friend. Including a pdf printout that makes it easy to decide whether or not to get involved. (PDF with businesness vs friendship decision -- are you building this as a favor to the friend or as a business move, stoak me, stoaked them, friendship strength, maturity of persons (ego vs genuinue desire to help))</p>
<h2>Friend's Stoak Level</h2>
<p>Are they commited and excited about what they are trying to do? And do they have enough free time over the next six months to really see where the idea takes them? If they've recently changed jobs, started dating someone new, and love playing candy crush the stoak level may sound high. But the real stoak level is actually going to be low. Because the enviornment they're living in isn't conducive to maintaining stoak</p>
<p>Tomorrow or the next day or a week from now. They might back out and leave you with a project that you don't feel connected to.</p>
<h2>My Stoak Level</h2>
<p>Facewook sounds awesome! And I'd work on it even if they weren't involved</p>
<h2>People talked to about "the idea"</h2>
<p>Less than 5 - no go
5 - 10 - maybe a go
10+ - we're in a good zone</p>
<h2>Part deus - laying the foundation</h2>
<h2>Friendship, Roles, and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>If you gonna go for it. Try to prioritize figuring out who will make what decisions, who will get what compensation, and how much time every person will spend on the project, what success looks like. There's a great doc [link is here] that breaks this down. I've included a version of it to reference. You could even use it to save some of the headache of having more than one person make a decision on something. Turns out people don't agree all the time and for startups it's better to make a decision today than agree on a decision an hour from now.</p>
<p>It's easy for feelings to get hurt in business and loosing a friend isn't worth it.</p>
<h2>Part 3 - Gumption Traps and Creativity</h2>
<p>Be on the lookout for Gumption Traps -- look for zen and ark of motorcycle maintence quote.</p>
<p>Some of the traps I've run in to are:</p>
<p>Helping non-technical people guide and build the product (feel stuck without input). Everyone uses a phone these day and should be able to at least draw pictures of what they'd like in an app. Link to pdf for printing or you can draw six squares -- see photo. App icon on iPhone screen. Launch screen. Tutorial. Three pages. Home screen. with two other tabs. Settings one other thing.</p>
<p>Equal effort or work combined with fair compensation. </p>
<p>Hardening for feedback cycle. Mindset that any feedback is good feedback.
* track all feedback, find a place for it so that someone who joins is able to read all the feedback up to current point to get a feel for the development of the company</p>
<h2>Part 4 - Mental Fortitude</h2>
<p>Startups die when the founders run out of courage. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes ya just got know when to fold em.</p>
<p>PDF List
[ ] Defined roles and responsibilities
[ ] Broke down equity and compensation
[ ] Talked about what success looks like personally and as a company
[ ] Have they talked with 10 potential customers
[ ] </p>
