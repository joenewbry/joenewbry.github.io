<p>KPIs - pre product</p>
<p>I'm working on an <a href="https://cadmium.app">animation company</a> and it's challenging. Because we're tackling an unsolved machine learning problem aka. we're not trying to identify cats on the interwebs. insert link Because we tackling a market with existing entrenched players. Hello Adobe. And we've got a compressed timeline. Specifically strikethrough $65k in the bank and a $30k / month burn rate. $40k in the bank and a $10k / month burn rat, $20k in the bank and $7k / month burn rate. And most specifically because it wasn't clear how to make meaningful progress.</p>
<p>At the begining I thought we just needed to get the product built. Because that's what businesses do they build things to sell to people. Then we talked with angels and VCs and they said don't worry about the product. Figure out how to sell the product. Sell what you have or get letters of intent to buy our software. Then we got advice to raise more money because money keeps us alive longer.</p>
<p>Build the product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well for us the cost of building this thing is somewhere in the $500k to $1M burger range --strikethrough-- I'm optimistic that we'll get this done by December. That's an expensive burger! Much better to offer a sample that costs $50k to build first to see if people like the burger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sell the product:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't know what we're selling yet. And this might be valid. I might not be enough of a sales person. Turns out this advice is right. You don't need to have a product to ask people questions about pricing. In fact it might be better because you're less tied to fitting what you've built into this other person world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raise money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising money is a lagging signal rather than a leading signal, meaning that successful companies raise money. Rather than comapies that raise money are successful. I could be wrong here. And I don't work in VC so I haven't seen underfunded companies die off many times although I have worked at a few companies that didn't find product market fit and couldn't raise. This might just be a process of how much do you want it and usually first time founders don't raise money until the last minute because the rejection is painful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Track rejections and success rates and post here.</p>
<p>Identify User Experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is experience is automatic colorization. Our business is built on the idea that there are painful moments in 2D cel animation TODO insert link that animators will pay for to have solved. One of them is adding the same set of colors to each frame in an animation. And we thought we had this figured out. We have an animation expert on our team. But we realized we didn't know the processing speed per frame that animators would like (faster here is better but how fast and what is the minimum speed). We had similar unanswered questions around coloring accuracy (did we need software to be 85% accurate or would animators start paying for our software at 70% accuracy levels). How would animators touch up the frames after these coloring predictions? We'd need a fill tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with this focus on what we needed to build it's still painful.</p>
<p>We want to build drawing features in our app but aren't because there are existing awesome drawing solutions. Our team loves to draw and loves drawing tools. In a real sense that's why the business was started.</p>
<p>We want to build a more fully featured bucket tool with an erase option. But this isn't core coloring experience.</p>
<p>I wonder now if we really need to have an app or if we can build a good integration into TV Paint that avoids all the headache of building an application.</p>                </article>
